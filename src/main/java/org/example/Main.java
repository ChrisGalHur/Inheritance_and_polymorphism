/**
 * Inheritance and polymorphism
 * <p>
 * Exercise 1
 *
 * <p>
 * In this exercise I was asked to create an instrument class:
 * - Subclasses string, wind and percussion
 * - Attributes name and price
 * - Method play() abstract that prints to console "This is sounding an instrument of [subclass]"
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The loading process only takes place once and I have to demonstrate that the load can be caused
 * by the creation of the first instance of this class or by accessing a static member of it.
 * </p>
 *
 * Exercise 2
 *
 * <p>
 * I have to create a "Car" class:
 * - Attributes brand, model power
 * - brand: static final
 * - model: static
 * - power: final
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * I have to demonstrate the difference between the three types of attributes and find out if any
 * can be initialized in the constructor.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Then I have to add two methods:
 * - static brake() that has to print to console "The vehicle is braking"
 * - non-static accelerate() that has to print to console "The vehicle is accelerating"
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * I have to demonstrate how to invoke the static and non-static method from the main class.
 * </p>
